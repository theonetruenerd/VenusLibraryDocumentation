Error Codes & Debugging
===========================

I will try compile as many different error codes and their explanations here, as well as potential causes and solutions to deal with them as and when they pop up. If there are any you wish to add, please message me on my discord "theonetruenerd" or email me at "tarunchapman@hotmail.com". Notably, the error codes that show up in the trace look slightly different to the ones presented here. If the trace error code looks like this: (0x12 - 0x3 - 0x45), then the translated error code will look like this: 0xa3120045. The error code should always be 10 digits long, with zeroes padding the bit between the 2 and 45.
